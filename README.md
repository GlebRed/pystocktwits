This is a Python Client for Stock Twits.

This sadly doesn't include most of the API methods as they require a access token which redirect you to a uri which you can get around with a flask app, but I didn't want to develop on that part as it wasn't really needed for data.

This was mainly made to just parse for the sentiment in messages. The other functionality was not really needed.

## Requirements

Also listed in requirements.txt:

-   requests

## Install

#### Install Locally

This was only tested in Python 3.6

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/khmurakami/pystocktwits
$ cd pystocktwits
$ python setup.py install
```

#### Install inside a virtualenv

```shell
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ python3 -m virutalenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ git clone https://github.com/khmurakami/pystocktwits
$ cd pystocktwits
$ python3 setup.py install
```

## Using the Python Wrapper

Descriptions of files can be found inside pystocktwits.py

Get Messages from a User/User.id

```python
from pystocktwits import Streamer

twit = Streamer()

# Get User Messages by ID
raw_json = twit.get_user_msgs("170", since=0, max=1, limit=1))

return_json_file(raw_json, 'result.json')
```

Response (This JSON was shortened because it was too long):

```json

# Return raw json as JSON file
return_json_file(raw_json, 'result.json')

## Testing using Unit Tests

Run test script to test if it works properly

```shell
$ python tests/pystocktwits_test.py
```

## Using Curl Requests to Test

These curl requests are from the Stocktwits API site and are not mine. They can be found here: <https://api.stocktwits.com/developers/docs>

```shell
$ cd example_curl_requests
$ ./streams_user_curl.sh
```
